# League Rank 

Calculates league rankings based on match results.

Accepts input on stdin, and writes result to stdout.

A sample makefile is provided to show how to build and run the program.
If you do not use make, you can still read the makefile to see the 
build and run commands.

Use 
```shell
make all
```
to build the executable `ranking`.

Use
```shell
make run
```
for an example of how to run the `ranking` program.

## Requirements
* Recent version of go (built with 1.17)
* make (to use the makefile)
* Unix-ish OS (tested on Linux 5.10)
